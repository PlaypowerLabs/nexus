# Archived: Old React Dashboard

This folder contains the previous React-based dashboard implementation.

## Status

🗄️ **ARCHIVED** - No longer in active development

## What Was Here

- React + TypeScript dashboard
- Game catalog with filtering
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Grade-level filtering
- SCORM data integration

## Why Archived?

The project has pivoted to a **landing pages portfolio approach** where:
- Multiple independent landing page designs are developed in parallel
- Each landing page has its own folder and deployment
- No shared React dependencies
- Simpler for non-technical team members to contribute

## New Structure

See the root README.md for the new landing pages approach.

Landing pages are located in:
- `apps/landing-hero-focused/`
- `apps/landing-grid-showcase/`
- `apps/landing-minimal-clean/`
- And more...

## If You Need This Code

This code is preserved in git history and in this archive folder for reference.

**Date Archived:** December 2024  
**Reason:** Pivoted to static landing pages approach
